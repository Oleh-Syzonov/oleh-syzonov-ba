## 💡 My BA Approach

### Requirements Elicitation
- Start with "why" - understand business objectives before diving into features
- Use multiple techniques: workshops, interviews, observation, document analysis
- Ask probing questions to uncover unstated assumptions

### Documentation Philosophy
- Write for the audience - technical specs for developers, business language for stakeholders
- Keep it concise but complete - every requirement should add value
- Use visual models (BPMN, UML) to complement written requirements

### Stakeholder Management
- Build trust through transparency and reliable delivery
- Proactively communicate changes and manage expectations
- Facilitate rather than dictate - best solutions come from collaboration

### Agile Delivery
- Stories should be INVEST-compliant (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
- Definition of Ready prevents wasted sprint time
- Continuous refinement beats big upfront design
